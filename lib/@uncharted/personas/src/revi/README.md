# revi - es6 data visualization toolkit
### Reference counted model
- Objects can be retained/released and get destroyed automatically
- Objects can be auto-released
- Destroying an object completely flattens the dependency tree to improve garbage collection speed in older browsers

### Canvas-based scene graph
- Implements cached nodes and canvas layers for improved performance
- Only redraws nodes when changes are detected
- Automatic event propagation
- Includes classes to render primitive shapes and images
- Nodes support positioning and sizing using CSS-style meassurements (i.e. '50%', '50px', 50)

### Custom text rendering system
- Can load TTF, WOFF and other OpenType fonts from URLs or Base64 strings.
- High quality text rendering through canvas
- Text is rendered exactly the same on all browsers
- Flexible text layout engine

### Input manager
- Handles user input and automatically dispatches events to all relevant nodes.  
TBD  

### Animation system
TBD
